### Hi there (OlÃ¡ !) My name is MaurÃ­cio Cunha and I am a Ph.D. student from Brazil. I work with soil science since my undergraduate and now I am being challenged by the process of making and validating the doctoral thesis. Therefore, this profile will serve as a basis for publishing my database and statistical analysis. I hope that my challenges can help other researchers along this path. !ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¦’
